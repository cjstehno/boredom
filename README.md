# Cards Against Boredom

This is a demo application I am playing with to learn [Ratpack](http://ratpack.io) development. It is a simple single-
page web application that provides a random set of black and white cards from the card game 
[Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com). They provide their content under a Creative Commons license
and I have provided a collection of their card data pulled from their web site.
