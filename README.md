# Cards Against Boredom

This is a demo application I am playing with to learn [Ratpack](http://ratpack.io) development. It is a simple single-
page web application that provides a random set of black and white cards from the card game 
[Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com). Sometimes it's amusing, sometimes it's dull, and sometimes
it's oddly accurate.

A live version of the application is deployed on a free-tier of [Heroku](http://heroku.com) at 
[https://cardsagainstboredom.herokuapp.com](https://cardsagainstboredom.herokuapp.com) - being that this is a free-tier
account, it may be down or slow to start up due to usage restrictions (be patient). What you will see, should look like
the following:

## Build

    ./gradlew clean build
    
## Running Locally

To run the server locally:

    ./gradlew run
    
or, with continuous reload (on change):
    
    ./gradlew -t run
    
## Publish to Heroku

This is mostly for my use or general information, but you need an account on heroku and you need their tools downloaded
for your specific OS. Then:

   heroku login
   
to login and once you are ready to push and have all changes committed:
   
   git push heroku master
   
which should push to the heroku server.
